# Thesis code
This repository holds the source code that was used in my thesis

# Structure

The source code is divided into 3 modules:
* `thesis/odx` - origin, destination and interchange inference
* `thesis/optimization` - bus route optimization
* `thesis/base` - code common to both odx and optimization modules (schedule classes, gtfs, utils, etc)
